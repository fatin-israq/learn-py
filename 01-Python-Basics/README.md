# Python Basics

This section covers fundamental Python concepts that form the foundation of programming in Python.

## Contents

### Core Concepts
- `hello-world.py` - Basic Python syntax and print statements
- `if-else.ipynb` - Conditional statements and decision making
- `loops.ipynb` - For loops, range(), and iteration

### String Operations  
- `string-operations.py` - String indexing, length, and immutability
- `string-methods.py` - String methods (title, upper, lower, replace, count)
- `string-formatting.py` - F-strings and advanced formatting

### Data Structures & Algorithms
- `word-frequency-counter.py` - Dictionary operations and word counting

## Learning Path

Follow this recommended order:

1. **`hello-world.py`** - Start here for basic syntax
2. **`string-operations.py`** - Learn string basics and indexing
3. **`string-methods.py`** - Explore string manipulation methods
4. **`string-formatting.py`** - Master string formatting techniques
5. **`if-else.ipynb`** - Understand conditional logic
6. **`loops.ipynb`** - Learn iteration and control flow
7. **`word-frequency-counter.py`** - Apply concepts in a practical example

## Learning Objectives
