## 🎯 Overview

This repository documents my complete Python learning journey, covering everything from fundamental programming concepts to advanced object-oriented programming and numerical computing with NumPy. Perfect for beginners and intermediate learners looking for practical examples and exercises.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

### 🔤 **Python Basics**
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions and scope
- Error handling and debugging
- File operations and I/O

### 🏗️ **Object-Oriented Programming**
- Classes and objects fundamentals
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Polymorphism and duck typing
- Encapsulation and data hiding
- Abstraction with abstract classes
- Multiple inheritance and MRO
- Special methods (`__str__`, `__init__`, etc.)

### 🔢 **NumPy Essentials**
- Array creation and manipulation
- Mathematical operations
- Broadcasting and vectorization
- Array indexing and slicing
- Statistical functions
